## Getting Support

## Note
This is a forked version of CyberScores. The original repo can be found here: https://github.com/glen3b/CyPatScoreboardBot. Currently, the original repo is not actively maintained so I decided to create this fork. If the main repo will be maintained again, this fork will follow up and include all updates from it.

## Disclaimer
This bot is not affiliated with [Air & Space Forces Association](https://www.afa.org/) or the [CyberPatriot Program](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/). Scores and standings on the CyberPatriot Competition System live scoreboard, and those reported by the bot, are unofficial and subject to review and adjustments.
